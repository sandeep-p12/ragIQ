Current assets totaled $6,076 and was comprised solely in cash accounts. An account statement from the CU indicated $25 on deposit while the remaining liquidity was not verified by third party account statements.

# Industry Information

The following industry information has been derived from IBISWorld.com for NAICS – 531110; Apartment Rentals in the US:

Operators in this industry act as lessors of buildings used as residences or dwellings. Industry participants are ownerlessors of residential buildings and establishments that rent real estate and then act as lessors by subleasing it to others. In addition to apartments, the industry also rents single-family homes and town houses.

COVID-19 Impact:

• Revenue for the Apartment Rental industry is expected to rise marginally in 2020 and in 2021 as inflation pushes rent up. • Rising inflation is pushing up costs of operation and rent, further challenging consumer affordability. • Competition with homeownership has never been fiercer, with the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic driving significant demographic change and urban flight, weakening industry revenue. The prospect of a rate increase by the Federal Reserve may curtail this home buying activity.

# Executive Summary

For rent: An oversupply of rentals is expected to hamper industry revenue. Operators in the Apartment Rental industry have performed strongly over most of the five years to 2021; however, industry performance has decelerated in more recent years, showing signs of structural weakness. Since the subprime mortgage crisis, the industry has undergone structural change. Leading up to the crisis, most investment in real estate was carried out by institutional investors (those that own 10 properties or more); whereas today, most properties for rent are single-investor-owned and nonowner-occupied. Decreasing rental vacancy rates during the period enabled landlords to increase rents, aiding revenue and profit growth through most of the period. However, the global outbreak of COVID-19 (coronavirus) is expected to have severe, perplexing and long-reaching impacts on this industry. Industry revenue is expected to rise an annualized 2.7% to reach $193.9 billion over the five years to 2021, including a small bump of 0.3% in 2021.

Currently, the industry is also being affected by the global coronavirus outbreak. Trends in 2020 were less than favorable due to rising unemployment and urban flight, which caused significant decline in rents in some metro areas, while others in more suburban areas appreciated, yielding mixed performance amid a decline in vacancy. The consumer price index for all urban consumers: rent of shelter (US city average) via the St. Louis Federal and the National Apartment Rent Index, according to Apartment List, both show a trend of stagnation in 2020 and to date increases in 2021. However, in terms of inflation adjusted revenue returns to industry operators, it appears that inflation in excess of 5.0% for months has to diminished industry revenue gains despite the recent rebound in rents.

Over the five years to 2026, industry revenue is expected to decline, falling an annualized 4.3% to $155.5 billion. This anticipated decline is likely a consequence of an oversupply of luxury units, with most current growth stemming from an undersupply of affordable units, causing supply crunch in the middle market. Moreover, with the September expiration of the eviction moratorium, vacancy is expected to spike over the next five years which is anticipated to restrain landlords' pricing power and by extension, industry revenue and profit growth. Furthermore, competition with homeownership as a consequence of demographic shift is expected to drag on industry performance in line with rising vacancy and declining consumer affordability.

Asking and Effective Rent

During February, asking rents relinquished a portion of January's increase, declining by 0.1% to $1,632. Mean unit prices in the metro are as follows: studios $1,256, one bedrooms $1,422, two bedrooms $1,763, and three bedrooms $2,292. Over the past twelve months, asking rents have increased a total of 12.7%, up from $1,448. Since the beginning of Q1 2012, the metro as a whole has recorded an annual average increase of 4.2%. Effective rents, which exclude the value of concessions offered to prospective tenants, also fell by 0.1% during February. The identical rates of change suggest that, although rents drifted downward, landlords have avoided increasing the relative value of incentives packages used to attract new renters. During the past 12 months, positive movement in asking rent was recorded in all twenty-eight of the metro's submarkets.

Competitive Inventory, Household Formations, Absorption

Net new fourth quarter household formations in the Philadelphia metropolitan area were 3,288. Of course, not all newly formed households immediately become apartment renters, but an analysis of longer-term economic and demographic trends can be useful in understanding the current quarter's level of demand. Since the beginning of Q1 2012, household formations in Philadelphia have averaged 0.5% per year, representing the average annual addition of 9,800 households. During February, net absorption totaled 101 units, while there was no new development; the net effect of absorption and construction dynamics caused the vacancy rate to drift downward by 10 basis points to 4.0%. Over the last 12 months, market absorption totaled 5,153 units, 45.6% greater than the average annual absorption rate of 3,538 units recorded since the beginning of Q1 2012. This vacancy rate matches exactly the metro's long-term average recorded since the beginning of Q1 2012.

# Outlook

During 2022 and 2023, 7,148 additional units are projected to be introduced to the metro inventory. Net new household formations at the metro level over the same period are anticipated to average 0.7% annually, enough to facilitate an absorption rate averaging 3,155 units per year. Because this amount does not exceed the forecasted new construction, the market vacancy rate will rise by 20 basis points to finish 2023 at 4.4%. On an annualized basis, asking and effective rents are expected to advance at a rate of 4.3% through year end 2023, reaching average rates of $1,743 and $1,675 per unit, respectively.
