Leading up to the crisis, most investment in real estate was carried out by institutional investors (those that own 10 properties or more); whereas today, most properties for rent are single-investor-owned and nonowner-occupied.

Trends in 2020 were less than favorable due to rising unemployment and urban flight, which caused significant decline in rents in some metro areas, while others in more suburban areas appreciated, yielding mixed performance amid a decline in vacancy.
