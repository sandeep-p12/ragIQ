Because this amount does not exceed the forecasted new construction, the market vacancy rate will rise by 20 basis points to finish 2023 at 4.4%. On an annualized basis, asking and effective rents are expected to advance at a rate of 4.3% through year end 2023, reaching average rates of $1,743 and $1,675 per unit, respectively.",
