The tax returns were prepared on a joint basis with his spouse, however, her income and taxes have not been included as she is not a personal guarantor on the loan request. GUARANTOR 1 also provided his 2021 W2 and a P&L through March of 2022 for his Schedule C business.\n\nGUARANTOR 1’s personal cash flow demonstrates a DSCR of 3.38x based upon the 2020 personal financial information received for analysis compared to 3.79x in 2019 and 4.64x in 2018. Total income during the three-year period of review has increased from $118,060 in 2018 to $148,271 in 2019 before declining slightly to $147,432 in 2020 as GUARANTOR 1 reported less interest/dividend income in 2020 while wages and business income increased over the prior periods. Income sources include wages as a Real Estate Manager, interest/dividend income, distributions of $6,120, less capital contributions of $4,188 from/to the borrowing entity and business income from his Real Estate Management Company Black Hat Equity, LLC as shown on Schedule C of his personal tax returns. Business income, after addbacks for depreciation and interest expense, totaled $14,593 in 2020 compared to $10,502 in 2019 and $1,001 in 2018. Expenses for the period ending 2020 were derived from living expenses (20%) and taxes paid (federal and state). Total personal debt of $33,120 was derived from mortgage, installment and revolving debt per the recent personal credit report.\n\nThe analyst prepared a pro-forma cash flow which demonstrates a 1.57x DSCR based upon the following income/expense changes:\n\n• Inclusion of wages per provided 2021 W2; • Carryover of interest/dividend income; • Inclusion of distributions/capital contributions from the borrowing entity per K1 within the 2021 business tax returns; • Inclusion of business income per the provided P&L through March 2022 (annualized); o Net income of $106,632 based upon revenues of $142,500 and expenses of $35,868.
