Of course, not all newly formed households immediately become apartment renters, but an analysis of longer-term economic and demographic trends can be useful in understanding the current quarter's level of demand. Since the beginning of Q1 2012, household formations in Philadelphia have averaged 0.5% per year, representing the average annual addition of 9,800 households.\n\nDuring February, net absorption totaled 101 units, while there was no new development; the net effect of absorption and completions was that inventory caused the vacancy rate to drift downward by 10 basis points to 4.0%. Over the last 12 months, market absorption totaled 5,153 units, 45.6% greater than the average annual absorption rate of 3,538 units recorded since the beginning of Q1 2012. This vacancy rate matches exactly the metro's long-term average recorded since the beginning of Q1 2012.",
