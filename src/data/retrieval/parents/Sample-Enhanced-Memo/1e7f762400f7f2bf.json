The tax returns were prepared on a joint basis with his spouse, however, her income and taxes have not been included as she is not a personal guarantor on the loan request. The below analysis takes into account the three most recent years of financials.\nGUARANTOR 2’s personal cash flow exhibits a DSCR of 2.06x based on the 2021 personal financial information received for analysis compared to 2.11x in 2020 and 1.58x in 2019. Income during the three-year period of review has increased from $111,346 in 2019 to $114,437 in 2020 to $139,175 in 2021 as wages, distributions received and rental income increased in 2021. Income sources were derived from wages from Rabbi, interest/dividend income, distributions from the borrowing entity and rental income from one investment property as shown on Schedule E of the personal tax returns. GUARANTOR 2 received distributions from the borrowing entity of $10,850 in 2021 compared to $6,220 in 2020 and $2,840 in 2019. In addition, GUARANTOR 2 made capital contributions of $4,188 in 2020 as well to the borrowing entity. It should be mentioned that GUARANTOR 2 reported capital gains of $59,440 in 2021, however, the analyst excluded these from the cash flow as the capital gains appear to be from the sale, exchange or disposition of related entities which are gains from business capital that flows through to the individual for tax purposes. Expenses for the period ending 2021 were derived from a 20% living expense factor and taxes paid (federal and state). Total personal debt of $40,260 was derived from mortgage and revolving debt per the recent credit report.\nThe analyst prepared a pro-forma cash flow which demonstrates a 1.84x DSCR based upon the following income/expense changes:\nTable Header: GUARANTOR 2 | 12/31/2019 | 12/31/2020 | 12/31/2021 | Projected\nRow: INCOME | Tax Return | Tax Return | Tax Return | \nRow: Wages | $107,157 | $107,963 | $110,272 | $110,272\nRow: Interest/Dividend Income | $1,349 | $1,748 | $4,267 | $4,267\nRow: Distributions < Capital Contributions | $2,840 | $2,032 | $10,850 | $0\nRow: Net Income | $0 | -$530 | $3,476 | $3,476\nRow: Interest Expense | $0 | $1,581 | $4,679 | $4,679\nRow: Depreciation Expense | $0 | $1,643 | $5,631 | $5,631\nRow: Total Schedule E Income | $0 | $2,694 | $13,786 | $13,786\nRow: Total Income (subT) | $111,346 | $114,437 | $139,175 | $128,325\nRow: DEDUCTIONS |  |  |  | \nRow: Living Expenses (AMH 20%) | $22,269 | $22,887 | $27,835 | $25,665\nRow: Income Tax Expense | $12,603 | $14,910 | $32,974 | $21,930\nRow: Total Adjustments to CF | $34,872 | $37,798 | $60,809 | $47,595\nRow: Gross Cash Flow (subT) | $76,474 | $76,639 | $78,366 | $80,730\nRow: DEBT SERVICE |  |  |  | \nRow: Mortgage | $27,612 | $39,720 | $39,720 | $39,720\nRow: Revolving | $540 | $540 | $540 | $540\nRow: Total Debt | $28,152 | $40,260 | $40,260 | $40,260\nRow: Excess Funds | $48,322 | $36,379 | $38,106 | $40,470\nRow: DSCR | 1.58 | 2.11 | 2.06 | 1.99\n\nDocument: Sample-Enhanced-Memo | Page: 8 | Section: Business Financial Analysis for BORROWER\n\n# Business Financial Analysis for BORROWER\nThe borrowing entity is a real estate holding company that was established in October 2016 for the sole purpose of acquiring and managing the subject property.
