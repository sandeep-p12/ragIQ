It should be mentioned that GUARANTOR 2 reported capital gains of $59,440 in 2021, however, the analyst excluded these from the cash flow as the capital gains appear to be from the sale, exchange or disposition of related entities which are gains from business capital that flows through to the individual for tax purposes. Expenses for the period ending 2021 were derived from a 20% living expense factor and taxes paid (federal and state). Total personal debt of $40,260 was derived from mortgage and revolving debt per the recent credit report.\n\nThe analyst prepared a pro-forma cash flow which demonstrates a 1.84x DSCR based upon the following income/expense changes:\n\n• Carryover of wages, interest/dividend income and rental income (an updated rent roll was not available at time of underwriting); o The CU should obtain and review an updated rent roll to verify that rental income is in line with projections. • Exclusion of distributions as historic amounts varied and future amounts are unknown and cannot be predicted; • Recalculation of living expenses and taxes paid as income changed for the period; and, • Carryover of debt.\n\n# Business Financial Analysis for BORROWER\n\nThe borrowing entity is a real estate holding company that was established in October 2016 for the sole purpose of acquiring and managing the subject property.

As a whole, operating expenses consisted of insurance, legal/professional, repairs, taxes, utilities and other related operating expenses.\n\nDepreciation and interest expense totaled $24,694 in 2021 compared to $30,559 in 2020 and $27,388 in 2019.

The entity also received capital contributions of $8,376 from the owners in 2020.\n\n# Rent Roll\n\nAccording to the borrower, the subject property is a two-story multifamily building that is fully leased.\n\nA copy of a rent roll was not provided, however, leases are on file and indicated all six units are leased on a month-to-month basis. The oldest leases date back to 2017 for three units while the other three units recently commenced in 2020. According to the provided lease agreements, the property generates $4,450 in monthly rental income or $53,400 in gross annual rents.\n\nThe entity anticipates a net operating income of $32,845, less a 5% vacancy factor, carryover of historical operating expenses, less depreciation and interest expense, as well as, exlsuion of distributions as future amounts are unknown and cannot be predicted.\n\n# Balance Sheet\n\nThe 2021 balance sheet exhibits a net worth of $101,229 compared to $113,061 in 2020 and $116,021 in 2019.\n\nCapital for the period consisted solely of retained earnings. Assets have declined 7% from 2019 to 2021, totaling $361,318 in 2019, $352,525 in 2020 and $336,013 in 2021. The decline appears to be from a decline in cash accounts coupled with an increase in depreciation reported on net fixed assets. Current assets totaled $6,076 and was comprised solely in cash accounts.\n\nCurrent assets totaled $6,076 and was comprised solely in cash accounts. An account statement from the CU indicated $25 on deposit while the remaining liquidity was not verified by third party account statements. The CU should obtain and review account statements to verify the remaining liquidity position and ability to support the repayment of debt in the event of cash flow interruptions. The listed cash is sufficient to cover approximately 2.5 months of the entity’s annual debt service.\n\nNon-current assets totaled $329,937 and consisted of land valued at $32,686 and net fixed assets after accumulated depreciation of ($73,111). Liabilities have declined 4% from 2019 to 2021, totaling $245,297 in 2019, $239,464 in 2020 and $234,784 in 2021 as long-term debt has been paid down.\n\nCurrent liabilities totaled $3,800 and consisted solely of security deposits. Non-current liabilities consisted solely of long-term debt held by the CU.\n\n# Debt Service Ability\n\nIn 2021, the entity demonstrated cash available for debt service of $12,862 compared to $27,599 in 2020 and $29,231 in 2019.\n\nThe 2021 CAFDS was based upon the net income of $8,968 plus the add-back of depreciation of $13,596 and interest expense of $11,098, less distributions of $20,800 paid to the owners.\n\nDebt service totals $15,780, indicating a DSCR of 0.82x in 2021 compared to 1.75x in 2020 and 1.85x in 2019. It should be mentioned that the 2021 DSCR is below the CU recommended minimum and appears to be impacted by the distributions of $20,800 paid to the owners.\n\nOn a pro-forma basis (when considering the provided leases) cash available for debt service is $32,845 when based upon gross rents of $53,400, less a 5% vacancy factor and carryover of 2021 historical operating expenses. Debt service totals $32,208 after the existing CU mortgage is refinanced with the proposed mortgage, indicating a pro-forma DSCR of 1.02x.\n\n# Industry Information\n\nThe following industry information has been derived from IBISWorld.com for NAICS – 531110; Apartment Rentals in the US:\n\nOperators in this industry act as lessors of buildings used as residences or dwellings. Industry participants are owner\u0002lessors of residential buildings and establishments that rent real estate and then act as lessors by subleasing it to others. In addition to apartments, the industry also rents single-family homes and town houses.\n\nCOVID-19 Impact:\n\n• Revenue for the Apartment Rental industry is expected to rise marginally in 2020 and in 2021 as inflation pushes rent up. • Rising inflation is pushing up costs of operation and rent, further challenging consumer affordability. • Competition with homeownership has never been fiercer, with the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic driving significant demographic change and urban flight, weakening industry revenue. The prospect of a rate increase by the Federal Reserve may curtail this home buying activity.\n\n# Executive Summary\n\nFor rent: An oversupply of rentals is expected to hamper industry revenue. Operators in the Apartment Rental industry have performed strongly over most of the five years to 2021; however, industry performance has decelerated in more recent years, showing signs of structural weakness. Since the subprime mortgage crisis, the industry has undergone structural change. Leading up to the crisis, most investment in real estate was carried out by institutional investors (those that own 10 properties or more); whereas today, most properties for rent are single-investor-owned and nonowner-occupied. Decreasing rental vacancy rates during the period enabled landlords to increase rents, aiding revenue and profit growth through most of the period. However, the global outbreak of COVID-19 (coronavirus) is expected to have severe, perplexing and long-reaching impacts on this industry. Industry revenue is expected to rise an annualized 2.7% to reach $193.9 billion over the five years to 2021, including a small bump of 0.3% in 2021.\n\nCurrently, the industry is also being affected by the global coronavirus outbreak. Trends in 2020 were less than favorable due to rising unemployment and urban flight, which caused significant decline in rents in some metro areas, while others in more suburban areas appreciated, yielding mixed performance amid a decline in vacancy. The consumer price index for all urban consumers: rent of shelter (US city average) via the St. Louis Federal and the National Apartment Rent Index, according to Apartment List, both show a trend of stagnation in 2020 and to date increases in 2021. However, in terms of inflation adjusted revenue returns to industry operators, it appears that inflation in excess of 5.0% for months has to diminished industry revenue gains despite the recent rebound in rents.\n\nOver the five years to 2026, industry revenue is expected to decline, falling an annualized 4.3% to $155.5 billion. This anticipated decline is likely a consequence of an oversupply of luxury units, with most current growth stemming from an undersupply of affordable units, causing supply crunch in the middle market. Moreover, with the September expiration of the eviction moratorium, vacancy is expected to spike over the next five years which is anticipated to restrain landlords' pricing power and by extension, industry revenue and profit growth. Furthermore, competition with homeownership as a consequence of demographic shift is expected to drag on industry performance in line with rising vacancy and declining consumer affordability.\n\n# Industry Information\n\nThe following industry information has been derived from IBISWorld.com for NAICS – 531110; Apartment Rentals in the US:\n\nOperators in this industry act as lessors of buildings used as residences or dwellings.

In the nine-year period beginning with Q1 2012, the Center City submarket has experienced the greatest introduction of new inventory, 10,901 units, amounting to 29.0% of all new market rate rentals added to the market.\n\nAsking and Effective Rent\n\nDuring February, asking rents relinquished a portion of January's increase, declining by 0.1% to $1,632. Mean unit prices in the metro are as follows: studios $1,256, one bedrooms $1,422, two bedrooms $1,763, and three bedrooms $2,292. Over the past twelve months, asking rents have increased a total of 12.7%, up from $1,448. Since the beginning of Q1 2012, the metro as a whole has recorded an annual average increase of 4.2%. Effective rents, which exclude the value of concessions offered to prospective tenants, also fell by 0.1% during February. The identical rates of change suggest that, although rents drifted downward, landlords have avoided increasing the relative value of incentives packages used to attract new renters. During the past 12 months, positive movement in asking rent was recorded in all twenty-eight of the metro's submarkets.\n\nCompetitive Inventory, Household Formations, Absorption\n\nNet new fourth quarter household formations in the Philadelphia metropolitan area were 3,288. Of course, not all newly formed households immediately become apartment renters, but an analysis of longer-term economic and demographic trends can be useful in understanding the current quarter's level of demand. Since the beginning of Q1 2012, household formations in Philadelphia have averaged 0.5% per year, representing the average annual addition of 9,800 households. During February, net absorption totaled 101 units, while there was no new development; the net effect of absorption and construction dynamics caused the vacancy rate to drift downward by 10 basis points to 4.0%. Over the last 12 months, market absorption totaled 5,153 units, 45.6% greater than the average annual absorption rate of 3,538 units recorded since the beginning of Q1 2012. This vacancy rate matches exactly the metro's long-term average recorded since the beginning of Q1 2012.\n\n# Outlook\n\nDuring 2022 and 2023, 7,148 additional units are projected to be introduced to the metro inventory. Net new household formations at the metro level over the same period are anticipated to average 0.7% annually, enough to facilitate an absorption rate averaging 3,155 units per year. Because this amount does not exceed the forecasted new construction, the market vacancy rate will rise by 20 basis points to finish 2023 at 4.4%. On an annualized basis, asking and effective rents are expected to advance at a rate of 4.3% through year end 2023, reaching average rates of $1,743 and $1,675 per unit, respectively.\n\n# Market Information\n\nThe following market information has been derived from REIS.com for the Philadelphia market area:\n\nMarket Overview\n\nThe Philadelphia apartment market is comprised of 237,347 units in twenty-eight geographic concentrations ranging in size from the 26,254 unit Center City submarket to the Olney/Oak Lane submarket, which amounts to 2,870 units.

Industry participants are owner\u0002lessors of residential buildings and establishments that rent real estate and then act as lessors by subleasing it to others. In addition to apartments, the industry also rents single-family homes and town houses.\nCOVID-19 Impact:\n• Revenue for the Apartment Rental industry is expected to rise marginally in 2020 and in 2021 as inflation pushes rent up. • Rising inflation is pushing up costs of operation and rent, further challenging consumer affordability. • Competition with homeownership has never been fiercer, with the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic driving significant demographic change and urban flight, weakening industry revenue. The prospect of a rate increase by the Federal Reserve may curtail this home buying activity.\n\nDocument: tmpwuj9b3wc | Page: 9 | Section: Executive Summary\n\n# Executive Summary\nFor rent: An oversupply of rentals is expected to hamper industry revenue. Operators in the Apartment Rental industry have performed strongly over most of the five years to 2021; however, industry performance has decelerated in more recent years, showing signs of structural weakness. Since the subprime mortgage crisis, the industry has undergone structural change. Leading up to the crisis, most investment in real estate was carried out by institutional investors (those that own 10 properties or more); whereas today, most properties for rent are single-investor-owned and nonowner-occupied. Decreasing rental vacancy rates during the period enabled landlords to increase rents, aiding revenue and profit growth through most of the period. However, the global outbreak of COVID-19 (coronavirus) is expected to have severe, perplexing and long-reaching impacts on this industry. Industry revenue is expected to rise an annualized 2.7% to reach $193.9 billion over the five years to 2021, including a small bump of 0.3% in 2021.\nCurrently, the industry is also being affected by the global coronavirus outbreak. Trends in 2020 were less than favorable due to rising unemployment and urban flight, which caused significant decline in rents in some metro areas, while others in more suburban areas appreciated, yielding mixed performance amid a decline in vacancy. The consumer price index for all urban consumers: rent of shelter (US city average) via the St. Louis Federal and the National Apartment Rent Index, according to Apartment List, both show a trend of stagnation in 2020 and to date increases in 2021. However, in terms of inflation adjusted revenue returns to industry operators, it appears that inflation in excess of 5.0% for months has to diminished industry revenue gains despite the recent rebound in rents.\nOver the five years to 2026, industry revenue is expected to decline, falling an annualized 4.3% to $155.5 billion. This anticipated decline is likely a consequence of an oversupply of luxury units, with most current growth stemming from an undersupply of affordable units, causing supply crunch in the middle market. Moreover, with the September expiration of the eviction moratorium, vacancy is expected to spike over the next five years which is anticipated to restrain landlords' pricing power and by extension, industry revenue and profit growth. Furthermore, competition with homeownership as a consequence of demographic shift is expected to drag on industry performance in line with rising vacancy and declining consumer affordability.\n\nDocument: tmpwuj9b3wc | Page: 9 | Section: Industry Information\n\n# Industry Information\nThe following industry information has been derived from IBISWorld.com for NAICS – 531110; Apartment Rentals in the US:\nOperators in this industry act as lessors of buildings used as residences or dwellings.

Because this amount does not exceed the forecasted new construction, the market vacancy rate will rise by 20 basis points to finish 2023 at 4.4%.\nOn an annualized basis, asking and effective rents are expected to advance at a rate of 4.3% through year end 2023, reaching average rates of $1,743 and $1,675 per unit, respectively.\n\nDocument: tmpwuj9b3wc | Page: 19 | Section: MBFS Analyst Notes\n\nTable Header: MBFS Analyst Notes\nRow: • Obtain account statements for GUARANTOR 2 to verify the remaining personal liquidity positions\n# MBFS Analyst Notes\n• Obtain account statements for GUARANTOR 2 to verify the remaining personal liquidity positions and ability to support the repayment of debt in the event of cash flow interruptions.\nTable Header: MBFS Analyst Notes\nRow: • Obtain account statements for GUARANTOR 2 to verify the remaining personal liquidity positions\n\nDocument: tmpwuj9b3wc | Page: 19 | Section: MBFS Analyst Notes\n\n# MBFS Analyst Notes\n• Obtain account statements for GUARANTOR 2 to verify the remaining personal liquidity positions and ability to support the repayment of debt in the event of cash flow interruptions.\nTable Header: MBFS Analyst Notes\nRow: • Obtain account statements for GUARANTOR 2 to verify the remaining personal liquidity positions\n\nDocument: tmpwuj9b3wc | Page: 19 | Section: MBFS Analyst Notes\n\n# MBFS Analyst Notes\n• Obtain account statements for GUARANTOR 2 to verify the remaining personal liquidity positions and ability to support the repayment of debt in the event of cash flow interruptions.\n\nDocument: tmpwuj9b3wc | Page: 21 | Section: CREDIT UNION LOAN DECISION\n\n# CREDIT UNION LOAN DECISION\n\nDocument: tmpwuj9b3wc | Page: 22 | Section: BORROWER TREE:\n\n# BORROWER TREE:\nA.
